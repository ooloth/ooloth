### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com).

I spend a most of my time writing TypeScript and Python these days, but I also enjoy dabbling in Rust when time allows. My background is heavily weighted towards front-end web development, and particularly the intricacies of building fast-loading, accessible websites using React frameworks like [Next](https://nextjs.org) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com). 

Outside of work, I enjoy [blogging](https://michaeluloth.com/), creating [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/michaeluloth) and toying with side projects that help automate my cares away.
