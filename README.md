### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the API team at [ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/).

The vast majority of my experience is in frontend web development, particularly using [React](https://reactjs.org) frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and [Next](https://nextjs.org) to build fast-loading, accessible websites. But after 4 years building marketing sites and 2.5 years building the ecommerce experience on [ecobee.com](https://www.ecobee.com), I've decided (at least for now) to transition into a backend role to round out my skills and continue learning as much as I can.

Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with side projects, usually built with [Next](https://nextjs.org) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/):

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making my personal website easier to update from my phone using [Next](https://nextjs.org) and the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Remix](https://remix.run), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and all things [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a lightweight component library for rendering [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com) blocks with semantic HTML and unopinionated styles
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to automate more of my daily programming tasks and effectively use [Notion](https://www.notion.so) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) as a "second brain"
- 💬 Ask me about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [React](https://reactjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) or to-do lists
- 📫 Feel free to reach me as [@ooloth](https://twitter.com/ooloth) on Twitter or by [email](mailto:hello@michaeluloth.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I got hooked coding on back when I was an opera singer and needed a portfolio website and didn't want to pay anyone else to build it :)
