### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com).

The majority of my experience is in front-end web development, and particularly building fast-loading, accessible websites with frameworks like [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). But I'm enjoying the opportunity to develop new backend skills at Recursion by also diving into tools like Python, Terraform and Kubernetes.

Outside of work, I enjoy [blogging](https://michaeluloth.com/), creating [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/michaeluloth) and tinkering with side projects.

Feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) or by [email](mailto:hello@michaeluloth.com).
