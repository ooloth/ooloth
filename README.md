### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the API team at [ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/).

The majority of my experience is in front-end web development, and particularly building fast-loading, accessible websites with [React](https://reactjs.org) frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Next](https://nextjs.org) and [Remix](https://remix.run). But after 7 years building marketing and ecommerce experiences, I've decided to round out my full-stack skills by taking on a back-end role.

Outside of work, I enjoy [blogging](https://michaeluloth.com/writing), creating [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/michaeluloth), and tinkering with side projects:

- 🔭 I’m working on making my personal website content easier to update from my phone using [Next](https://nextjs.org) and the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com)
- 🌱 I’m learning [Remix](https://remix.run), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and all things [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to most effectively use [Notion](https://www.notion.so) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) as a "second brain"
- 💬 Ask me about [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [React](https://reactjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) or by [email](mailto:hello@michaeluloth.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I taught myself to code back when I was an opera singer and needed a website but didn't want to pay anyone to build it :)
