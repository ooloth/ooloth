### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com).

The majority of my experience is in front-end web development, and particularly building fast-loading, accessible websites with static site generators like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [React](https://reactjs.org) frameworks like [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). But I'm enjoying flexing my backend muscles at Recursion by diving into new (to me) tools like Python and Kubernetes.

Outside of work, I enjoy [blogging](https://michaeluloth.com/), creating [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/michaeluloth), and tinkering with side projects.

Feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) or by [email](mailto:hello@michaeluloth.com).
