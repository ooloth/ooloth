### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the API team at [ecobee](https://www.ecobee.com/).

The majority of my experience is in front-end web development, and particularly building fast-loading, accessible websites with [React](https://reactjs.org) frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Next](https://nextjs.org) and [Remix](https://remix.run). But after 4 years building marketing sites and 2.5 years building the ecommerce experience on [ecobee.com](https://www.ecobee.com), I've decided to transition (at least for now) into a back-end role to round out my skills and continue learning as much as I can.

Outside of work, I enjoy [blogging](https://michaeluloth.com/writing), making [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/michaeluloth), and tinkering with side projects, usually built with [Next](https://nextjs.org) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/):

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making my personal website easier to update from my phone using [Next](https://nextjs.org) and the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Remix](https://remix.run), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and all things [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to most effectively use [Notion](https://www.notion.so) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) as a "second brain"
- 💬 Ask me about [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [React](https://reactjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) or by [email](mailto:hello@michaeluloth.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I taught myself to code back when I was an opera singer and needed a website and didn't want to pay anyone to build it :)
