### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com).

The majority of my experience is in front-end web development, and particularly building fast-loading, accessible websites with [React](https://reactjs.org) frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Next](https://nextjs.org) and [Remix](https://remix.run). But I'm excited to flex my backend muscles at Recursion by diving into new (to me) tools like Python, Flask and Kubernetes.

Outside of work, I enjoy [blogging](https://michaeluloth.com/writing), creating [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/michaeluloth), and tinkering with side projects:

- 🔭 I’m working on making my personal website content easier to update from my phone using [Next](https://nextjs.org) and the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com)
- 🌱 I’m learning [Remix](https://remix.run) and [Python](https://www.python.org)
- 🤔 I’m pondering the best ways to use tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so), [Bear](https://bear.app) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) as a "second brain"
- 💬 Ask me about [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [React](https://reactjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) or by [email](mailto:hello@michaeluloth.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I taught myself to code when I was an opera singer and too broke to pay anyone to build me a website :)
