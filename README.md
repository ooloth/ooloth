### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com).

I spend a most of my time writing TypeScript and Python 🐍 these days, but I also enjoy dabbling in Rust 🦀 and getting to know Claude Code 🤖. My background is heavily weighted towards front-end web development, and particularly the intricacies of building fast-loading ⚡, accessible :accessibility: websites using React ⚛️ frameworks like [Next](https://nextjs.org). 

Outside of work, I enjoy [blogging](https://michaeluloth.com/) ✍️, creating [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/michaeluloth) 🎬 and toying with side projects that help automate my cares away. 🤖

Feel free to reach out!
